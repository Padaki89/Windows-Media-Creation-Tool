Installing Windows 11 on Unsupported PCs via Windows Update or Mounted ISO (No Patching Required)

Step 1: Utilize Skip_TPM_Check_on_Dynamic_Update.cmd to automatically bypass setup requirements.

This script is designed for ease of use, featuring a built-in undo option. Version 7 employs a more reliable /Product Server trick, while Version 9 has been rebased on cmd to address Defender issues and skips already patched media (0b).

Step 2: Use OfflineInsiderEnroll to subscribe to your desired channel.

While on Windows 10, select BETA for Windows 11 22000.x builds (release) and DEV for Windows 11 225xx.x builds (experimental).

Step 3: Check for updates via Settings > Windows Update and select Upgrade to Windows 11.
Installing Windows 11 on Unsupported PCs via MediaCreationTool.bat

The MediaCreationTool.bat creates Windows 11 media that will automatically bypass clean install checks.

The Auto Upgrade preset, or launching auto.cmd from the created media, will automatically bypass upgrade checks.

Please note that running setup.exe from the created media may not guarantee the bypass of setup checks (it should work for now).

To avoid adding the bypass to the media, use the MCT Defaults preset or rename the script to def MediaCreationTool.bat.

    Note: For a more reliable and future-proof experience,

    clean installations are still managed via winsetup.dll patching in boot.wim.

    Upgrades are now handled via auto.cmd using the /Product Server trick.

    Please disregard the 'Windows Server' label.

    Update: The old-style 0-byte bypass has been temporarily reintroduced as it remains effective on release.

Important: The Skip_TPM_Check_on_Dynamic_Update.cmd operates globally and skips setup.exe upgrade checks,

regardless of whether the mounted ISO or USB media already has a bypass applied.
Adding a Bypass to an Existing Windows 11 ISO, USB, or Extracted Files

To add a bypass, use Quick_11_iso_esd_wim_TPM_toggle.bat conveniently from the right-click SendTo menu.

This script switches the installation type to Server, thereby skipping installation checks, or reverts to Client if executed again on the same file, restoring the hash.

It operates directly on any downloaded Windows 11 ISO or extracted ESD and WIM files, eliminating the need for ISO or DISM mounting.

This process is notably efficient.

This method is particularly effective with business/enterprise media, as it includes ei.cfg, preventing setup from requesting a product key at the start.

For consumer/core media, you can manually add a generic EI.cfg to the media\sources directory with the following content:

Code

[Channel]
_Default

    If setup still prompts for a product key, you may enter retail or GVLK keys found in media\sources\product.ini:

    gvlkprofessional=W269N-WFGWX-YVC9B-4J6C9-T83GX

    gvlkcore=TX9XD-98N7V-6WMQ6-BX7FG-H8Q99

    gvlkenterprise=NPPR9-FWDCX-D2C8J-H872K-2YT43

    gvlkeducation=NW6C2-QMPVW-D7KKK-3GKT6-VCFB2

Important: The Skip_TPM_Check_on_Dynamic_Update.cmd operates globally and skips setup.exe upgrade checks,

regardless of whether the mounted ISO or USB media already has a bypass applied.
Offline Local Account Setup on Windows 11 Home/Pro

The MediaCreationTool.bat creates media that re-enables the I don't have internet option during the OOBE (Out-Of-Box Experience) process (OOBE\BypassNRO).

This is accomplished through the inclusion of AutoUnattend.xml, which is inserted into boot.wim to prevent issues with setup.exe under Windows.

For added convenience, this file can be placed at the root of the Windows 11 media, along with auto.cmd for upgrades.

This solution should be compatible with any Windows 11 Release (22000.x) or Dev (22xxx.x) media, and it also suppresses unsupported PC notifications as an added benefit.

If you have already connected during OOBE, you may attempt to switch to a local account using email: a and password: a.
Managing and Troubleshooting Windows Update on Any Windows Version and Edition

Utilize windows_update_refresh.bat to clear pending updates, including hidden feature upgrades.

Employ windows_drivers_update_toggle.bat to block driver updates, even on Home editions.

Use windows_feature_update_toggle.bat to block feature upgrades on versions 1507 - 21H2, even on Home editions.
